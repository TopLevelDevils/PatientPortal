Explanations

Description

Use Cases

PDF Document that outlines and describes all of the use cases of our program

Use Case Diagram

An Astah representation of our use cases and how these all interconnect. Dependencies between all actions and how all of the sub-menus work together.

Object Identification

Identify all of the objects that are created within the program and their dependencies. Objects that consist of others, the parent and child relationships. For each use-case scenario from above to, identify objects involved in the scenario including the ones within the system/software.

Initial Class Diagram and class descriptions

Create and develop the initial class diagram for the Patient Portal including all objects, their dependencies and the methods/functions that these objects can do.

Identify all of the objects in the system.

Include a paragraph descriptions and and UML representation of the object.

This UML representation should include the name, attributes and operations

The class diagram of all dependencies and relationships using Astah.

 Note that all classes should be related in some way to one another

Test Plan and Functional Testing

TBD

Initial Prototype Code

First development code as well as all of the methods that have been described above working together.

This is done by using JavaFX.

Team Roles

Using the Scrum Agile Development technique, a Scrum Master and a Team Leader will be assigned. From there members will be assigned to certain tasks out of these four to be completed.The amount of members assigned to a certain task will vary, however, the amount will be correlated to the difficulty and value of work ahead.
