## Deliverables  

**Cover Page**  
**Project Overview**  
**User's Guide/Walkthrough**  
**Credit Sheet**  

Individual peer evaluation will be required and done separately  

__All above items are to be submitted as a single combined PDF__  
However, we will work on all of these in their own separate files before we concatenate them together  

## Explanations

1. **Cover Page**  
- This portion is worth 5 points, should be completed by one person. This accounts for less than 10% of the total points for this phase.  

2. **Project Overview**
- This portion is worth 20/65 points, and therefore should be completed by at least two people. This accounts for 31% of this phase project points.  

3. **User's Guide/Walkthrough**  
- This is the largest portion of this phase and therefore should be completed by at least 3/5 team members. This portion accounts for ~46% of the total points for this phase.  

4. **Credit Sheet**  
- Same as the cover page, should only be done by one person and is worth 5 points (<10%).  

## Team Roles  

Using the Scrum Agile Development technique, a Scrum Master and a Team Leader will be assigned. From there members will be assigned to certain tasks out of these four to be completed.  
The amount of members assigned to a certain task will vary, however, the amount will be correlated to the difficulty and value of work ahead.

## Phase 1 Deliverable Updates  

### Cover Page [Version 1.0.1]     
Cover page created and edited with Confluence as a part of Jira. This page now includes all team members names and our team number. This page will be the first item submitted documenting the members of this project.  

! Updated Personal brief resumes in addition with this submission. These will be included as a part of the cover page to detail the previous experience of our members.  

### Project Overview [Version 1.0.1]  

Project overview has been updated and is being updated with all information that pertains to completing the project on time and correctly.

- Correct patient, nurse and doctor information  
- Dependencies and development structure  


### User's Guide/Walkthrough [Version 1.0.1]
The users guide and walkthrough went through multiple versions. This is comprised of all code mentioned here and within the 
Patient Portal directory. This code is the main working of the JavaFX project and allows our application to be both functional
and do its purpose. 

The main code of this project was done by Mark A. and the user's guide walkthrough was written by Sara and Samuel. Mark compiled 
all code and information into one cohesive file [Final Submission](./Submission/Phase1_Submission_Final.pdf). 
Project contributions can also be located within the ./Submissions/ directory.

Version 1.0.1 houses the base code and data for the doctor, nurse and patient. Does NOT include a database for information and houses only
minor amounts of error checking. The fundamental outline of the program has been written and should be refactored and edited 
throughout the rest of this Agile Development Process.


### Credit Sheet [Version 1.0.1]  
One credit sheet was made by Juls. This sheet details the information of all those who were in the group and what they 
personally contributed to the project. This contribution can be found at [Final Submission](./Submission/Phase1_Submission_Final.pdf)
