# Patient Portal

---

About: This program was developed to be used within the current medical operating environment. By interpreting the types of interactions between patients, nurses and doctors, one can choose actions based on their role. There are three main roles which represent the three main **actors** of this program. Below will describe the main functionality of thise code and how it can be used as well as a descriptive guide on how to get it running yourself.

## Dependencies and Coding Language

---

The Patient Portal program was coded in Fall of 2021 and was coded in Java using JavaFX and Java FXML. Java is a versitile language and supports graphical user interfaces and computations between backend code and the front end user view.

Java FXML contains the XML formatted code that displays information to the user. This information is the shell of the program and where the users (actors) can input and manipulate their information.

A good understanding of Java methods including Iterators and certain behavioral characteristics including oververs allow the user to gather a better understanding of what is happening. An observer subscribes to an action and is notified when something happens. This occurs between all of the ActionEvents that occur in these Java methods and controller classes. i.e Notified to change the input text-box once this button is clicked.

Not only are these buttons used, but a variety of these Java elements. A short but not complete list includes, TextAreas, TextFields, PasswordFields, Buttons, ComboBoxes and many more.

All of these elements work together and interact with one another to develop a complete working program.
