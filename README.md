## Deliverables  

**Cover Page**  
**Project Overview**  
**User's Guide/Walkthrough**  
**Credit Sheet**  

Individual peer evaluation will be required and done separately  

__All above items are to be submitted as a single combined PDF__  
However, we will work on all of these in their own separate files before we concatenate them together  

## Explanations

1. Cover Page  
- This portion is worth 5 points, should be completed by one person. This accounts for less than 10% of the total points for this phase.  

2. Project Overview
- This portion is worth 20/65 points, and therefore should be completed by at least two people. This accounts for 31% of this phase project points.  

3. User's Guide/Walkthrough  
- This is the largest portion of this phase and therefore should be completed by at least 3/5 team members. This portion accounts for ~46% of the total points for this phase.  

4. Credit Sheet  
- Same as the cover page, should only be done by one person and is worth 5 points (<10%).  

## Team Roles  

Using the Scrum Agile Development technique, a Scrum Master and a Team Leader will be assigned. From there members will be assigned to certain tasks out of these four to be completed.  
The amount of members assigned to a certain task will vary, however, the amount will be correlated to the difficulty and value of work ahead.  

__Phase 1 Roles__  

Scrum Master = Tanishq Mor  
Team Leader = Mark Ashinhust
